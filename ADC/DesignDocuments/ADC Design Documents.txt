This document describes the different levels of testing the adc driver.

Level 0
=======

Hardware Setup
==============
1. Mote under test (MUT)
2. A reference mote or test harness

Software Setup
==============
The software setup is basically the DAC test in reverse. The test makes the assumption that the dac driver is 
working consistently. The program running on the reference mote will be a PRNG generating numbers between 0 and 4095.
These are fed as input to the DAC driver on the reference mote. The output of the dac driver is wired to the input of
the adc on the test mote. The test adc driver compares the value generated as output to the same PRNG value. 

If the output of the adc is same as the value generated from the PRNG then the a gpio pin on the MUT is raised high else
low. The test is successful if the pin remains high through the course of the test. 

Note: This test can also be carried out on the same mote by wiriing the adc input to the output of the dac. The driver 
of the dac input will run as a separate thread from the adc value verification program.
