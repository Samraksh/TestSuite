This document describes a test for the DAC driver. There are different levels as desribed below:

Level 0:
========

1. The Level 0 test is used to check the basic functionality of the dac driver. 

Hardware Setup
==============
1. Mote under test.
2. Another mote connected to the dac output of the mote under test though the adc or test harness.

Software Setup
==============
  The setup consists of a psuedo random number generator (PNRG) that generates numbers between 0 - 4095 in psuedo 
random order. The output of the PNRG is set as input to the DAC driver. A timer is used to change this value at constant
intervals of may be 1000ms. 
  The output of the dac is connected to the adc of the reference mote or test harness. The reference mote also uses the 
same PRNG and is aware of the order in which the voltage should be generated. The output of the adc is tested against the
PRNG and if outputs are similar a gpio pin is set high else low. The success of the test is determined by whether the pin 
is set high throughout the course of the test. 

Note : The test can be carried out with same mote if the adc and dac pins are exposed and if there is confidence in the 
working of the adc driver.
